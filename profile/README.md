# The Context Graph Factory for AI

TrustGraph is an **open-source Context Operating System** that enables organizations to **build, manage, and deploy intelligent context graphs**. Transform fragmented enterprise data into AI-optimized context structures that power accurate, trustworthy AI agents.

- **Build Context Graphs** — Automatically extract entities, relationships, and knowledge structures from your enterprise data
- **Manage Context** — Organize, version, and govern your context graphs with enterprise-grade tools and custom ontologies
- **Deploy Intelligent Agents** — Run AI agents grounded in your own precise context with full visibility and control
- **Maintain Full Sovereignty** — Keep your data and AI stack entirely under your control, deployed on-prem, in the cloud, or on bare metal

## Key Capabilities

### Context Graph Construction

- **Automated Entity & Relationship Extraction** — AI-powered agents automatically identify key concepts and connections in your data
- **Ontology-Driven Graphs** — Define what *should* be extracted, not just what *can* be extracted, for consistent, controlled knowledge representation
- **Multi-Format Data Support** — Process PDFs, documents, databases, APIs, and structured data sources simultaneously
- **Vector Embedding Integration** — Automatic semantic embeddings mapped to graph relationships for hybrid retrieval

### Context Management

- **Context Cores** — Package and version your processed context for reuse across projects and deployments
- **Collections** — Organize knowledge by domain, project, or dataset with enterprise governance controls
- **Flow Configuration** — Design flexible data processing pipelines with runtime control and prompt management
- **Observability & Telemetry** — Monitor processing status, costs, performance, and agent behavior in real-time

### Agent Intelligence

- **GraphRAG Queries** — Intelligent retrieval combining graph structure and semantic search for deep contextual understanding
- **Agentic Workflows** — Build sophisticated agents that understand relationships, perform reasoning, and make decisions based on your knowledge
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — Connect agents to external tools, APIs, and services while maintaining grounded context
- **Multi-Model Support** — Deploy local open-source models or connect to Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, and other LLM providers

### Enterprise Infrastructure

- **Production Deployment** — Kubernetes-native, fully containerized, ready for enterprise scale
- **Cost Observability** — Real-time tracking of token usage, inference costs, and resource consumption
- **Access Controls & Secrets Management** — Enterprise security with fine-grained permissions and credential handling
- **Flexible Storage** — Graph databases (Neo4j, Cassandra, Memgraph), vector stores (Qdrant, Pinecone, Milvus), and support for structured data
